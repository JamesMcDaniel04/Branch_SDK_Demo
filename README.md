- âœ… No SDK compatibility issues
- âœ… Direct HTTP API integration
- âœ… Custom fallback handling
- âœ… Real-time link generation

### Key Branch Features Demonstrated
- Link creation with custom data
- Event tracking (standard and custom events)
- Deep link routing and handling
- Social sharing optimization

## Branch Integration Details

### Link Creation
```dart
final shareUrl = await BranchRestAPI.createBranchLink(
  title: 'Check out my monster: ${creature.name}!',
  description: 'I just created ${creature.name} in Monster Factory!',
  customData: {
    'monster_id': creature.id,
